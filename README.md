**Business Problem**
Flight delays significantly impact customer satisfaction, airline costs, and operational efficiency. The objective was to identify delay patterns and operational drivers contributing to frequent delays across routes and carriers.

**Why It Matters**
Reducing delays improves on-time performance, lowers compensation and fuel costs, and strengthens airline brand trust. Data-backed insights are critical for prioritizing operational interventions.

**Approach**
Used SQL to analyze structured air travel data, performing joins, aggregations, and time-based analyses to identify delay frequency, root causes, and high-risk routes. Segmented delays by airline, airport, time of day, and delay type to surface actionable patterns.

**Impact / Insights**
Identified specific routes, carriers, and time windows with disproportionately high delays. Highlighted operational bottlenecks that could be targeted to improve on-time performance and resource allocation.

**Tools Used**
SQL, Relational Databases, Analytical Querying
